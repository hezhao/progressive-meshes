FILE STRUCTURE
--------------


An SMF file is a text file consisting of a series of lines.  Each line
is interpreted independently and in sequence.  A line may have one of
the following three forms:

    (1) Entirely whitespace

            These lines are completely ignored.

    (2) A comment line, beginning with the character '#'

            These lines are also ignored.

    (3) A command line of the form: <op> <arg>*

            The first token on the line is interpreted as a command
            name.  The remaining tokens are arguments to the command;
            their interpretation is command-dependent.  Tokens are
            whitespace-separated character sequences.


Core Operators


    v <x> <y> <z>

        Defines a new vertex with coordinates [<x> <y> <z>].  Within a
        given scope, vertices are implicitly numbered starting from 1
        (NOT 0).

    f <v1> <v2> <v3>

        Defines a new triangular face whose corners are the vertices
        identified by the three numbers <v1> <v2> <v3>.  The vertices
        are generally assumed to be listed in counter-clockwise order.

    vsplit <number> <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2> <x3> <y3> <z3>

        Defines a new contraction identified by the three vertices 
        <v1> <v2> <v3>. where <v1> and <v2> is replaced with <v3>,
       and <number> is the sequence order of contraction.
